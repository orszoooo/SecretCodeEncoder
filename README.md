# SecretCodeEncoder
## How to use it
You have to be in the same directory as the compiled program.
- Windows CMD: SecretCodeEncoder "Sentence to encode"
- Windows PowerShell: ./SecretCodeEncoder "Sentence to encode"
- Linux: ./SecretCodeEncoder "Sentence to encode"
  
NOTE: It is not case sensitive.
If the program is executed without sentence as a parameter then it asks to provide the sentence.
